We don't want to set these clouds on fire. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.



In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Let all these things just sort of happen. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. The light is your friend. Preserve it.



There he comes. Take your time. Speed will come later. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. This is truly an almighty mountain.
