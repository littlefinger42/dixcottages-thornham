          <p>
            Thornham is a pretty village on the North Norfolk coast, an area of
            outstanding natural beauty and is an excellent base to explore the
            beautiful coastline and surrounding countryside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dix cottages are within walking distance of all village amenities
            including 3 pubs/restaurants, caf√© and deli. The Orange Tree is
            directly opposite, the Coach House and Lifeboat Inns are a couple of
            minutes walk away. Also nearby is an excellent farm shop selling
            local produce and the Thornham deli, fantastic for late breakfasts
            after a walk on the beach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thornham has a beautiful and unspoilt sandy beach, surrounded by
            marsh and inlets, reached via the coastal path. From here you can
            walk right along the coast towards Hunstanton. The RSPB reserve at
            Titchwell is just a mile from Thornham. Sailing, tennis, windsurfing
            and golf can be found nearby.
          </p>
